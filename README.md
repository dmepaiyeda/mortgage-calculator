# Mortgage Calculator 

This Mortgage Calculator will calculate your mortgage payment. It will also determine
your estimated payments for mortgage, and interest rates.

## Future work

Given more time, I would:
- write more tests to test all functionalities of the mortgage calculator
- add validation to the input fields to make sure the user enters information in the appropriate format
- add more features such as amortization period

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
